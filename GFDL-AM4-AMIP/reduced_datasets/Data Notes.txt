2006 - Data is from 01.07 to 31.12
2011 - Data is from 01.02 to 30.04


lat = full latitude dataset in sequence - for future use if needed
alt = from converted p (km), 80 levels
alt_temp = from converted plev (km), 19 levels - goes with temp_alt_lat only
temp = (alt, temperature (K))
pressure = (alt(m), pressure(Pa))
air_density = (alt) kgm^-3

tcc = (latitude, total cloud fraction)
tclw = (latitude, liquid water path (kg/m^2) specific content multiplied by integrated air density
tciw = (latitude, ice water path (kg/m^2) specific content multiplied by integrated air density

---specific content fraction multiplied by cloud fraction tcc---
tclw_frac = (latitude, liquid water fraction) 
tciw_frac = (latitude, liquid water fraction)


cf = (alt, cloud fraction)
cf_so = (alt, cloud fraction over southern ocean)
lw = (alt, specific liquid water content (kg/kg))
lw_so = (alt, specific liquid water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)
iw = (alt, specific ice water content (kg/kg))
iw_so = (alt, specific ice water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)


--- specific content fraction multiplied by cloud profile fraction cf and cf_so---
lw_frac = (alt, liquid water fraction) 
iw_frac = (alt, ice water fraction) 
lw_frac_so = (alt, liquid water fraction over southern ocean) 
iw_frac_so = (alt, ice water fraction over southern ocean) 


cf_alt_lat = (alt, lat) for contour plots
lw_alt_lat = (alt, lat) (kg/kg) for contour plots
iw_alt_lat = (alt, lat) (kg/kg) for contour plots
temp_alt_lat = (alt, lat) (K) for contour plots - note - temp alt different than above (less levels) - use alt_temp

cf_t = (temperature (K), cloud fraction)
cf_t_so = (temperature (K), cloud fraction over southern ocean)
lw_t = (temperature (K), specific liquid water content (kg/kg))
lw_t_so = (temperature (K), specific liquid water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)
iw_t = (temperature (K), specific ice water content (kg/kg))
iw_t_so = (temperature (K), specific ice water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)

--- specific content fraction multiplied by cloud profile fraction cf and cf_so---
lw_frac_t = (temperature (K), liquid water fraction) 
iw_frac_t = (temperature (K), ice water fraction) 
lw_frac_t_so = (temperature (K), liquid water fraction over southern ocean) 
iw_frac_t_so = (temperature (K), ice water fraction over southern ocean)
