2006 - Data is from 01.07 to 31.12
2011 - Data is from 01.02 to 30.04

lat = full latitude dataset in sequence - for future use if needed

tcc = (latitude, total cloud fraction)
tclw = (latitude, liquid water path (kg/m^2)
tciw = (latitude, ice water path (kg/m^2)

tclw_frac = (latitude, liquid water fraction) - base off lwc fraction multiplied by tcc
tciw_frac = (latitude, ice water fraction) - base off iwc fraction multiplied by tcc
