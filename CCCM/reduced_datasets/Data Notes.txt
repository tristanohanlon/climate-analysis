2006 - Data is from 01.07 to 31.12
2011 - Data is from 01.02 to 30.04

From Annual Datasets:

lat = full latitude dataset in sequence - for future use if needed

tcc = (latitude, total cloud fraction)
tclw = (latitude, liquid water path (kg/m^2)  mean value over entire CERES footprint - see CCCM-85 note
tciw = (latitude, ice water path (kg/m^2) mean value over entire CERES footprint - see CCCM-86 note

tclw_frac

alt = Irradiance layer center height profile (km), 137 levels for ice and liquid water profiles
alt_c = Layer center height profile (clouds and aerosol) (km), 113 levels for clouds
alt_t = Irradiance level height profile (km), 138 altitude levels for pressure and temperature. 

air_density_g = (g/m^3) 137 altitude levels
air_density_so = (g/m^3) 137 altitude levels

cf = (alt_c, cloud fraction profile)
cf_so = (alt_c, cloud fraction profile over southern ocean)
lw = (alt, specific liquid water content (kg/kg))
lw_so = (alt, specific liquid water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)
iw = (alt, specific ice water content (kg/kg))
iw_so = (alt, specific ice water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)

temp = (alt_t, temperature (K))
temp_so = (alt_t, temperature (K) over southern ocean)
pressure = (alt_t, pressure(hPa))
pressure_so = (alt_t, pressure(hPa) over southern ocean)

cf_t = (temperature (K), cloud fraction profile)
cf_t_so = (temperature (K), cloud fraction profile over southern ocean)
lw_t = (temperature (K), specific liquid water content (kg/kg))
lw_t_so = (temperature (K), specific liquid water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)
iw_t = (temperature (K), specific ice water content (kg/kg))
iw_t_so = (temperature (K), specific ice water content (kg/kg) over southern ocean)

For Raw Datasets:

cff = CCCM-21 used for finding total mean over CERES footprint - see CCCM-85 and 86 note
